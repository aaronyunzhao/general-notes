# general-notes

This repo is the collections of casual notes on my study and work.

These notes are not complete documents or detailed tutorials. They are just some informal (perhaps also unfinished) notes on what I have learned and tried. 

Anyway, if you have good ideas or suggestions, feel free to open issues or pull requests.

Last but not least, if you are inspired by some points or thoughts in my notes and have some good ideas on  relevant research projects, you are more than welcome to [contact me](https://refraction-ray.github.io/about/) so that we could hopefully work collaboratively on some research projects we both have interest in.
